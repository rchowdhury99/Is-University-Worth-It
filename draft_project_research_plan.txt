Draft Project Proposal plan:

Tuition data:
https://www.univcan.ca/universities/facts-and-stats/tuition-fees-by-university/
Provides graduate and undergraduate data for domestic and international students.

https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/daily-quotidien/180905/dq180905b-eng.pdf?st=KKHzDvP6
Provides graduate and undergraduate data based on field of study.

Income data:

New tentative questions:
Is it worth it to get a bachelor's degree as an:
	-International Student
	-Domestic Student
	-Also possible to analyze based on field of study

Is it worth it to get a graduate degree as an:
	-International Student
	-Domestic Student
	-Also possible to graph based on field of study

Plan:
Get mean income for level of study (undergraduate/graduate, variable = educ) from LFS data and calculate amount of time it takes to amortize tuition for all the previous categories mentioned. Tuition costs calculated from univcan.ca and statcan.gc.ca.

Also investigate unemployment based on undergraduate vs graduate degrees.

Based on results conclude if it is worth it to:
1. Get a bachelor's (international vs. domestic)
2. Get a masters (international vs. domestic)
3. Get a masters immediately after a bachelor's vs. after a few years
4. Most worth it field of study. (for undergraduate and graduate, for international and domestic)
5. Least worth it field of study. (for undergraduate and graduate, for international and domestic)
6. Comment on unemployment
