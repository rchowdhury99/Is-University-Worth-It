1,326.67C$ without rent/month + 2,028.95 rent/month Apartment (1 bedroom) in City Centre

*Assume cost of living during studies is covered, only focus on degree cost

Total_degree_cost = 4year * Annual_tuition 
Remaining_funds = Annual_income - Average_annual_cost

Time to amortize = Total_degree_cost(4 years) / Remaining_funds

Total_degree_cost = 4 * $8,367.00/year =  $33468 
Remaining_annual_funds = Annual_income - Average_annual_cost = $64,618 - $40272

Time to amortize = $33468 / $24346 = 1.37 ~ 1 year and 4 Months
