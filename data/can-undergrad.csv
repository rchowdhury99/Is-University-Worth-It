Footnotes:
1,Data for 2018/2019 are preliminary.
2,"The national and provincial tuition fee averages are weighted with the latest enrolment data (2015). If the number of enrolments is unknown for a given program, that program is excluded from the averages. The same enrolment data are used for the weighting of both years, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, thereby permitting the comparison of changes in the tuition fees only."
3,"As the distribution of enrolment varies from period to period, caution must be exercised when making long-term historical comparisons."
4,"For Quebec (since 1998/1999) and Nova Scotia (since 2007/2008), the weighted averages take into account the different fees paid by 'in province' and 'out of province' Canadian students."
5,"It is important to note that tuition fee increases are generally regulated by provincial policies. However, some programs may be exempted from these policies resulting in possible increases that exceed provincial limits."
6,Data in this release do not take into account financial assistance or tax rebates provided to students. Tuition fees and additional compulsory fees represent only a portion of all costs incurred for attending university.
7,"The fields of study are adapted from the 2011 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), Statistics Canada's standard for the classification of instructional programs."
8,"For 2018/2019, Newfoundland and Labrador undergraduate and graduate tuition fees were frozen for all Canadian students except for new out-of-province students who incurred a 30% increase. These students represent approximately 10% of the domestic student population. This increase is not reflected in the preliminary 2018/2019 data."
