Geography: Canada, Province or territory

Footnotes:	
1	Data for 2018/2019 are preliminary.
2	The national and provincial tuition fee averages are weighted with the latest enrolment data (2015). If the number of enrolments
	 is unknown for a given program, that program is excluded from the averages. The same enrolment data are used for the weighting of
	 both years, 2017/2018 and 2018/2019, thereby permitting the comparison of changes in the tuition fees only.
3	As the distribution of enrolment varies from period to period, caution must be exercised when making long-term historical comparisons.
4	For Quebec (since 1998/1999) and Nova Scotia (since 2007/2008), the weighted averages take into account the different fees paid by 'in province'
	 and 'out of province' Canadian students.
5	It is important to note that tuition fee increases are generally regulated by provincial policies. However, some programs may be exempted from 
	these policies resulting in possible increases that exceed provincial limits.
6	Data in this release do not take into account financial assistance or tax rebates provided to students. Tuition fees and additional compulsory 
	fees represent only a portion of all costs incurred for attending university.
7	The fields of study are adapted from the 2011 Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP), Statistics Canada's standard for the 
	classification of instructional programs.
8	For 2018/2019, Newfoundland and Labrador undergraduate and graduate tuition fees were frozen for all Canadian students except for
	 new out-of-province students who incurred a 30% increase. These students represent approximately 10% of the domestic student population. This increase is not reflected in the preliminary 2018/2019 data.
